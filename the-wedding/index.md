Erin and Dan will marry on July 18, 2011 at Monet's Place in Hudson Gardens in Denver. There will be a reception immediately following for our guests. There is ample parking at Hudson Gardens, a shuttle to and from the Gardens from the [Hampton Inn in Littleton](http://hamptoninn.hilton.com/en/hp/groups/personalized/D/DENHLHX-MLW-20110714/index.jhtml?WT.mc_id=POG), and a separate entrance for private events. The gardens will be available to anyone who wishes to see them after the reception, free of charge.
